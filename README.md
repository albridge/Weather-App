navigate to project folder ie "weather-app" using command line

start the express server with command "node server.js" without the quotes on command line
start the react frontend by running "npm start" on command line

in the single text box field in on the frontend type in a city name in full eg basel or paris or france and click the city name from the dropdown that appears to view weather details for the day

to view extra information when the page loads click the view more link to view more in a collapsible division below

to view weather forecast for one week click the "get 7 days forecast" link to display a line graph with forecast details

getting the weather icons to display was a pain in the \*\*\*. that part of the documentation should be clearer
